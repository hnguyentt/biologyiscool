Foundation of biology. | 6 proton + 6 neutron + 6 electron . | Two electron shells: 2 electrons locate on the first shell and 4 locate on the outer shell. . | Lewis dot structure | . Gilbert Lewis . The scientist behind these famous terms: . Lewis dot structure | Valency theory | Lewis acids and bases | . Some facts about him: He was nominated 35 times for Nobel’s Prize but ended up with zero prize. What a great man! . Octet Rule . Each atom needs 8 electrons in the outer shell … to be fulfilled and happy. . This is a rule of thumb for a “happy relationship” among atoms to form a long-lasting family (molecule). . Types of bonding . Covalent bonds . When atoms share electrons with each other. Ex: $CH_{4}$, $O_{2}$, $NH_{4}$ . Non-polar covalent bond. Ex: $O_{2}$ | Polar covalent bond: there exists negative and positive pole. Ex: $NH_{4}$ | . Amino acids are formed by covalent bonds. . Ionic bonds . do not share electrons | donate or accept electrons | live as a charged atom or ion | . Alkali metals + Halogens . Examples: $NaCl$, $KF$, etc. . Hydrogen bonds . Some molecules formed by polar covalent bonds can stick together. | Example: $H_{2}O$ References . | Lecture: Crash course | Britannia: Carbon chemical element | .",
