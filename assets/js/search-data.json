            "content": "Bibliography: William Prout . Became fascinated with human digestion, especially the urine. He thought the best way to understand human body is through chemistry, and the best way to understand the body’s chemistry was to understand what it does to food. | In the morning before coming to the hospital as a doctor, he did some great things that led to discovery of hydrochloric acid in stomachs and a breakthrough book about kidney stones called “An inquiry into the Nature and Treatment of gravel, calculus, and other diseases connected with a deranged operation of the urinary organs”. | The first person who discovered the chemical composition of pure urea. | Came to the conclusion that all “foodstuffs” fell into three categories: the saccharonous (carbohydrates), oleaginous (fats), and albuminous (proteins). | . 1. Carbohydrates . Sources of energy that we have available to us. | Made up of sugars, the simplest of them are monosaccharides. Monosaccharides and disaccharides are easy for the body to process so they are the instant sources of energy. Monocchacarides: glucose (synthesized by the plants from photosynthesis), fructose. | Disaccharides: sucrose (a glucose and fructose joined by covalent bond). | . | Larger saccharides are harder to be digested so they become storehouse of energy or structural compounds.Polysaccharides can contain thousands of sugar units. Cellulose –&gt; human can’t digest. | Starch: amylose –&gt; human can digest. | Glycogen: basically made up of the glucose we have left over after we eat and it seats in our muscles where it’s ready to be used and it’s also stored in our livers. (Image source: https://microbenotes.com/carbohydrates/) | . | . 2. Lipids . Smaller and simpler than complex carbonhydrates, and they group together because they share an inability to dissolve in water. | Made up mainly of two chemical ingredients: glycerol (a kind of alcohol) and fatty acid, which are long carbon-hydrogen chains that end in a carboxyl group. (Image source: https://www.visionlearning.com/es/library/Biologia/2/Lipids/207) | When three fatty acid molecules connect to a glycerol, we get a triglyceride. Triglyceride can be saturated (carbon atoms are connected with each other by single bond) or unsaturated (carbon atoms are connected with each other with double bonds). | Trans-fats are not good for human’s health. Omega-3 fatty acids are unsaturated at the 3 position, humans can’t synthesize them and they are essential fatty acids, meaning that we need to eat them. | Swab one of 3 fatty acids in triglyceride for a phosphate group, we will have a phospholipid. These make up cell membrane wall. one end polarity, which is attracted to water. | another end is nonpolar and it avoids water. –&gt; When we put a bunch of phospholipids into some water, they would automatically arrange themselves with hydrophobic ends facing each other, and hydrophilic end sticking out to face the water. | . | Steroids: have a backbone of 4 interconnected carbon rings, which can be used to form hundreds of variations. The most fundamental of them is cholesterol, which binds with phospholipids to help form cell walls. They can also activated into lipid hormones: estradiol, testosterone. | . 3. Proteins . The most complicated compound in the body. | Enzymes, antibodies, protein hormones. | Use 20 ingredients - amino acids (amino group + carboxyl group + R group). 9 amino acid that we can made by ourselves: Histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threnonine, tryptophan, and valine. | Amino acids connect to each other forming polypeptides. | .",

            "content": "Structure . Lewis structure | Bond: Polar covalent bond | Water is an amazing sovent | . Hydrogen bonds . Water molecules can attach to each other to form hydrogen bonds. It is because of polar covalent bond between O (-) and H (+) | . (Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/what-are-some-examples-of-hydrogen-bonds) . Cohesion . Attraction of 2 like-things. For example, the attraction between water molecules. | Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid. It can be seen when put water on some wax paper or some Teflon. That’s because water adheres weakly to the wax paper or to Teflon, but strongly to itself (kind of narcissitic), the water molecules are holding those droplets together in a configuration that creates the smallest surface area. | . Adhesion . Attraction between 2 different things. For example water and glasses. The adhesive forces between the water and the glass are stronger than the cohesive forces. | . Capillary Action . Thanks to adhesion, the water molecules are attracted to the molecules in the straw. | As the water molecules adhere to the straw, other molecules are drawn in by cohesion, following those fellow water molecules. | . Hydrophylic . Substances that are polar and their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of the water. | When put one of these polar substances in water, it’s strong enough that it breaks all the cohesive forces, all those little hydrogen bonds, and instead hydrogen bonding each other the water will hydrogen bond around these polar substances. | Examples: $NaCl$, $KF$, etc. | . Hydrophobic . Substances that lack charged poles, non-polar and are not dissolving in water because essentially they’re being pushed out of the water by water cohesive forces. | Examples: steroids | . Biography: Henry Cavendish . The first person to recognize hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and determine the composition of water. | In the 1700s, most people thought that water itself was an element, but Cavendish observed that hydrogen – which he called inflammable air, reacted with oxygen – known then by “dephlogisticated aire” – to form water. | Cavendish didn’t totally understand his discovery as he didn’t believe in chemical compounds and explained his experiments with hydrogen in terms of a fire-like element called “phlogiston”. After his deadth, researchers figured out that Cavendish had actually pre-discovered Ritcher’s law, Ohm’s law, Coulomb’s law. | . Ice density . Solid water is less dense than liquid while the everything else is exact opposite of that. | It is because of hydrogen bonds. At around 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degree Celcius), water molecules start to solidify and the hydrogen bonds in those water molecules form crystalline structures that space molecules apart more evenly, in turn making frozen water less dense that the liquid form. | . (Image source: https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/ice/) . It is lucky that the ice is floating. Just imaging all the ice in the North Pole sink, the sea level will be up, put many areas in the water. | . Heat Capacity . Water has a very high heat capacity, it means that water is really good at holding on to heat. Therefore, it is hard to heat up or cool down the ocean significantly. | The ocean become giant heat sinks that regulate the temperature and the climate of our planet. | When water evaporate from your skin, it cools you down. That’s the principal behind sweating. | .",
