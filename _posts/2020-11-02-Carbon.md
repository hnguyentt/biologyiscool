## About carbon
* Foundation of biology.
* 6 proton + 6 neutron + 6 electron
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/carbon.jpg)

* Two electron shells: 2 electrons locate on the first shell and 4 locate on the outer shell.

## Gilbert Lewis

The scientist behind these famous terms:
* Lewis dot structure
* Valency theory
* Lewis acids and bases

Some facts about him: He was nominated 35 times for Nobel's Prize but ended up with zero prize.
What a great man!

## Octet Rule
> Each atom needs 8 electrons in the outer shell ... to be fulfilled and happy.

This is a rule of thumb for a "happy relationship" among atoms to form a long-lasting family (molecule).


## Types of bonding
### Covalent bonds
When atoms share electrons with each other. Ex: $CH_{4}$, $O_{2}$, $NH_{4}$
* Non-polar covalent bond. Ex: $O_{2}$
* Polar covalent bond: there exists negative and positive pole. Ex: $NH_{4}$

Amino acids are formed by covalent bonds.

### Ionic bonds
* do not share electrons
* donate or accept electrons
* live as a charged atom or ion

Alkali metals + Halogens

Examples: $NaCl$, $KF$, etc.

### Hydrogen bonds
* Some molecules formed by polar covalent bonds can stick together.
* Example: $H_{2}O$
